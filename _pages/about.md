After working as an apartment manager for many years, I decided I wanted to go back to school and learn something new. Throughout my life I have always been interested in the newest technology, spending my free time teaching myself to code, playing video games, and checking out the latest tech gadgets.

At college, I took a geology class and thought I found my passion. I enjoyed being out in the field with my fellow students, my family, or my friends; using the rocks and landforms to tell the story of Earth’s history. Yet, I couldn’t scratch that technology itch. I spent my time outside of class researching GIS mapping systems, drone technology, and taking extra SQL and Project Management classes at the community college.

An encouraging professor set me on the right path to my Computer Science degree, and I am seizing every opportunity that comes my way. My favorite classes are when I am working to make the best C++ projects possible. I enjoy solving problems and learning new things, and there is no shortage of new things to learn in computer science.

While I’m finishing up my degree, I’m educating children in coding through Google CS First, chess club, and my hexabot project Shellanore. I enjoy sharing that “Ah-ha!” moment when they figure out how to make their coding work.

I’m always looking for opportunities to try something new. I also enjoy connecting with people I can learn from. Feel free to connect with me, even if it’s just to chat!
